# Tetrix

A modern JavaFX implementation of the classic Tetris game, featuring customizable gameplay settings and a clean, intuitive interface.
Created as part of 

## Game Overview

Tetrix challenges players to strategically position falling tetromino pieces to create complete horizontal lines. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the player earns points. The game progressively increases in difficulty as the player advances, with pieces falling at faster speeds.


## Technical Implementation

Tetrix is built using:
- **Java**: Core programming language
- **JavaFX**: UI framework for creating the game interface and animations

The architecture follows object-oriented design principles with clean separation between:
- Game logic
- UI components
- Configuration management

## Development Roadmap

- [x] Basic application structure and navigation
- [x] Configuration screen with customizable settings
- [x] Basic game screen with animation
- [x] Complete Tetromino implementation (all 7 classic shapes)
- [x] Game grid with collision detection
- [x] Score tracking system
- [x] Level progression
- [x Audio feedback and music
- [x] High score persistence
